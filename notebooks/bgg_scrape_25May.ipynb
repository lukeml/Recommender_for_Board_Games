       "[\" The GameLike the other games of the ‘North Sea’ trilogy, Explorers of the North Sea is a game about Vikings! In this game, the players will placing tiles and moving their Viking longships in an effort to most efficiently collect livestock, raid settlements, attack enemy ships, and control islands. Let’s see how the game plays! The Board and ComponentsThe board is comprised of the starting tile (of which there are 2, double sided) and 48 game tiles, one of which will be placed at the start of each player turn. There are 26 livestock (3 cattle, 3 horses, 4 sheep, 5 goats, 6 chickens, 6 pigs). These will spawn on their respective tiles and will be collected by the players (i.e. there are only 3 tiles with a cow in the stack of 48).There are 14 settlement tokens. These are randomly placed when settlements enter the game board and indicate the strength of the settlement and how many points are gained if it is raided by a player.The game also includes 12 enemy ship tokens. These will also spawn on the indicated tiles. 6 of these tiles will indicate one of the attacking Viking players died in the attack (points are gained for dead Vikings) and 6 do not kill the player’s Viking.Finally, each player will have 1 of the 11 captain cards and one longship, 5 outposts, and 7 Vikings in their color.  The last components are the score sheet (much like in 7 Wonders), and the first player token.The GameplayEach player starts with a longship containing 2 vikings on the starting tile and 3 of the 48 tiles in hand.  Their other Vikings start on the mainland and will be used later. The starting player is chosen randomly. A player’s turn follows this order:1. Place a tile2. Take up to 4 actions3. Draw a tilePlace a tileThe active player must place one of their tiles somewhere on the board. Each edge much match the surrounding tiles. Land must be attached to land and water to water. There are no exceptions to this; all sides of the placed tile must match. Tiles can never directly join the mainland, where the other Vikings reside. Each tile has in illustration of a livestock, enemy ship, or settlement which goes onto that tile. In each instance, take one of the indicated tiles/pieces and place it. Enemy ships and settlements are placed randomly, as some of the enemy ships will kill a player Viking and others won’t, while settlements vary in points.Take up to 4 actionsThe players have a few different actions to choose from those actions are:1. Load longship2. Unload longship (and deliver livestock)3. Move longship (and destroy enemy ship) 4. Move Vikings (and raid settlement)5. Transport livestock6. Construct an outpost (takes 2 actions)For one action, a player may load up to 3 Vikings and/or livestock into their longship. The maximum number of livestock/Vikings a ship may carry at any time is 3. To load a longship, the player’s Vikings and livestock must be on one piece of land and on the same tile as their longship. Livestock cannot load themselves, and require the presence of a Viking in the ship (if being loaded) or must be moved with a Viking.For one action, a player may unload up to 3 Vikings and/or livestock from their ship onto land. The restrictions for moving livestock are similar. Players will score end of game points if livestock are delivered to the mainland.For one action, the player may move their longship 1 tile. At least one Viking must be on board to move the ship. Multiple ships may occupy the same tile. If the player’s ship contains at least 2 Vikings, it may move into a space with an enemy ship. If this occurs, the enemy ship tile is defeated, which means it is revealed and then added to the player’s captain card. Half of the ships indicate that a player Viking has been killed in combat (this is why 2 are required to attack; one must be left to captain the ship). Dead Vikings will score VPs at the end of the game.For one action, the player may move 1 or 2 Vikings from land to connected land on an adjacent tile. This is how settlements are raided. If a player moves enough Vikings into a settlement to meet or exceed the strength indicated on the tile, it is successfully raided. The tile is added to the player’s captain card and will score at the end of the game.For one action, the player may transport 1 livestock with 1 Viking from one land space to connected land on an adjacent tile.For two actions, the player may construct an outpost on the point where 3 tiles are joined by land. This will score VPs and will help the player control islands, which will score more VPs. Each tile may only be connected to one outpost, so they can’t be tightly clustered on the board. The player must have 2 Vikings on the land tiles immediately surrounding the outpost being built. Outposts may never be moved or removed and the players are limited to 5 each.Draw a tileThe active player will draw a tile to refill their hand, and play will pass to the next player in clockwise order. If no tiles remain in the stack, that means the game is nearing its end.End of gameThe end of the game occurs after a number of rounds (12 for 4p, 16 for 3p and 24 for 2p). Ideally it’s when all 48 tiles have been placed, but occasionally a player will forget to place a tile on their turn, and it wouldn’t be fair to allow some players extra actions. Scoring occurs as follows:1. Delivered Livestock: the players’ goal is to collect a set of different livestock. 1 livestock is 1 VP but a set of 6 different livestock is 21 VP (1+2+3+4+5+6).2. Constructed outposts: 1 outpost is 2 VP, but 5 outposts is 20 VP (2+3+4+5+6).3. Destroyed enemy ships: each is worth 1 VP.4. Raided settlements: the players total their points gained on settlement tiles gained during raids.5. Viking deaths: the players gain points equal to their number of Vikings killed squared. 1 death is 1 point, while 3 would be 9 points.6. Controlled islands: a controlled island is one in which a player has more presence than any opponent. Each Viking counts as 1 for control and each outpost counts as 2. For each controlled island, the player will score 1 point per tile that adds to the island’s area.7. Captain cards: each player may score a couple extra points for their respective captain ability. Some may require the players to destroy enemy ships, control multiple islands, etc. They’re pretty straightforward.The player with the most points wins!Final ThoughtsStrengths:Variability – The tile placement leads to very different maps from game to game, altering play. Each game will feel very different.Artwork – This, like the other ‘Explorers’ games, is beautiful! Very colorful and well designed. Weaknesses:Scaling – More players increases the play time. It shouldn’t, because the number of tiles is the same, but  3 or 4 players pondering strategies rather than 2 leads the game to bog down a bit more. More players also increases the randomness. If you’re digging for certain tiles, there’s a much greater chance you’ll get the cow or horse you need in a 2 player game, where you see 24 tiles, than in a 4 player game (12 tiles). That leads me to my next point. It also decrease the number of actions you’ll take. In a 4 player game, you only have 12 turns, which is hardly enough to feel like you’ve done anything cool. For example, overtaking a 5-point settlement (depending on location) will likely require 4 or 5 turns!Randomness – Some strategies are very much in your control, others are very reliant on the deck and tile placement and location of other players. Gaining points dead Vikings is a neat idea, but losing a Viking isn’t that bad. If a player is lucky enough to lose 3 or 4 vikings during attacks, well you might as well chalk up a W for that player just because their fingers had better dead Viking sensors. Other things come down to randomness too; the tile draw, settlement points, livestock location, etc.Captains – I’m glad the rules allow you to choose from 2 of the captains, but I don’t like that some of the captains have strategies that are always within the players control (scoring islands far away, scoring 2nd largest island, etc.) and others are completely reliant upon gaining the correct tiles or having players help you out (extra points for defeating enemy ships, for example). In a game with a relatively low number of VPs, this lack of balance concerns me.Tile placement – Usually I find it fun to place a tile and throw a meeple down on it. In this game, I was often placing tiles on the other side of the map just so they didn’t clutter up the small part of the board that I was interacting with. In a 4p game with only 12 turns, you probably won’t actually get much accomplished or interact with a large part of the board.Player interaction – There’s not much of this and the interaction is only indirect. You might take a sheep that someone else wanted. When it comes to island control, there are so many islands, that they will rarely be contested (although possibly sniped during the last round). Why would I fight for one island, when I can head over to a vacated portion of the board and spread myself thinly on 2 or 3 islands?If your group of players isn’t at all interested in winning and things like balance, randomness, and interaction aren’t concerns of yours, then this game might be very fun for you! However, it’s long enough that I find myself pretty invested in the strategy, which leads me to be let down. So little of the game is in my control (less and less with more players), that I feel like it’s almost more of a simulation than a game. The mechanics are really pretty simple. It’s a very basic pick up and deliver game with a couple wrinkles. Most actions are spent moving, loading, and unloading; not particularly exciting if you ask me. I was very optimistic when we got this one out, but for me and my friends, the gameplay didn’t live up to the theme, artwork, and hype.How easy is the game to learn?  It’s not difficult to learn. You place a tile and take 4 actions. Very straightforward, and players will pick up on it quickly.Will it be easy to find players?  The art alone makes this a huge ‘yes’. The artwork is phenomenal and the theme is also one that will draw new players in. I’m not sure how keen players will be to play a 2nd or 3rd time though…Is the reward worth the time spent?  I really don’t feel that it is. Strategies are so heavily reliant on not only the tiles that you draw, but where other players place their tiles. With only 12 turns, you won’t be zooming across the board to do various things; movement is simply too costly. You’d better hope the points show up near you. I don’t feel like I have much agency in the outcome.How much fun is defeat?*  It’s not great. Mostly because I [likely] don’t have much opportunity to influence the winning players’ score. If someone is playing well, what can I do about that? Clog up their area with tiles they might not want, I suppose. But if my ship is in a different area of the board (which, really, it ought to be), there isn’t much I can do to influence the other players’ successes or failures. Without much agency, I don’t find losing to be very satisfactory. There isn’t much excitement in this game either; it’s very methodical.Overall score  *I think one of the best ways to evaluate a game is to consider how much fun it is to lose. The goal is to have fun whether I've won or lost!If you enjoyed reading this review, feel free to check out my other game reviews HERE\",\n",
       " \" Explorers is the third game of the North Sea trilogy by Garphill Games, all three games sharing similar components, art and the theme of vikings building, expandig and doing what vikings do best beyond the shores of their small village (but with different mechanics and bigger scope on each successive game). If you have played one of the previous two games you already know what to expect in terms of high quality production and colorful art, and this third offering comes packed with nice cardboard tiles, animal meeples, houses, strength tokens for the villages and viking meeples all of it made of wood, plus a small plastic longship for each player to explore, raid, and move their vikings and loot around the North Sea archipelago.   The gameplay feels a bit lighter than Raiders, possibly the lightest and more family-oriented game of the trilogy, but the multiple mechanics and scoring options in play give you enough stuff to consider, and the rounds move fast and with very little downtime even with three or four players.On your turn you always start by placing a tile on the map and it has to coincide with the territory around it (Carcassonne style).  Each tile brings into play some animals to steal, ships to sink or towns to attack, so you have to place the corresponding meeples or counters on it. Then you have up to four actions between moving your vikings by land or by boat to raid towns or steal animals, load or unload vikings and animals to and from your longship, or build settlements on the islands (it costs two actions and has special requirements) that will score by themselves and also count towards your control over the islands at the end of the game. Points are earned by the sets of different animals that you manage to steal and bring back to the mainland, for each completed island that you conquer by having more meeples/outposts than the other players on them, for the amount of outposts built, ships and settlements raided, for the amount of vikings that died in combat, plus a personal bonus that is awarded by fulfiling your captain's objective (the game comes with 11 different captains, each wich his/her own objective). There's not much direct player interaction but you can prevent the others from completing islands by placing your own tiles on strategic spots, steal their animals if they don't reach the boat fast enough (once in the boat, the animals are safe), and build your settlements or deploy your vikings to steal their control of an island.  We liked the game very much after a couple of plays with three and four players.  It's not a complex and long game, but it has enough factors to consider and keep you busy when you are looking for for a light strategy game that is also fast and relatively short (1 hour more or less). Playing it with just two gives every player more turns to act (the game always ends at 48 turns), and the opposite is be true with four players, making it more tight and with less chances for everyone to do a bit of everything because you only have 12 turns overall.  On successive plays we also found that having four players increases the amount of interaction around the table, because you often have the chance to build an outpost or raid a settlement when another player is just preparing to do it, forcing them to change their plans. There are also more opportunities for stealing animals and more competition for the control of the completed islands at the end.  With just two players (or even three sometimes) there is enough space for each to go exploring their own way and your paths don't need to cross that often unless you're really trying.  However, our scores have been pretty close so far over 6 or 7 games with different player counts, because there is a nice balance between the objectives that are easy to achieve but don't give much points (settlements, ships and controlling smaller islands), and the stuff that can potentially score high (cattle, building outposts and dead vikings) because those take a lot of movements and actions to complete, or hinder your ability to control more islands in the end, so there doesn't seem to be a single most powerful strategy.\",\n",
       " \" Disclaimer: I have only played one game with my wife.Impression is below, here's how the game went if you are interested.The game went super smooth even though it was our first game. I drew Trader (2 VP for every 3 livestocks) as my Captain and her drew Watchman (extra VP per outpost on controlled island). I began my journey trying to capture as many livestocks as I can while her aim is controlling the islands. However, luck has it that she's the one having lots of tiles with livestock on it and I ended up with settlements. While I focus on moving the vikings while placing settlements in a reachable area, my wife focus on placing outpost to ensure islands control. Next she start to extend one island with her outpost to form a bigger island, here I pull sneaky move and steal some livestock from her islands. Although we began charting the sea in a different direction, it's only around middle of the game that our map started to bleed together and we are fighting for territory. Near the end of the game, I ventured in search of death at the hand of the enemy ship. My wife spreading her army out to several small islands that she placed earlier. At the end of the game I managed to edge her out at 61 to 56. I messed up two of her island so it couldn't be completed and I lost two vikings to the enemy and that's where the difference is I believe.My impressionIt was a great game! It's super easy to explain as well. Usually I had to go recheck the rules every now and then repeated to others several times during the game. Turn actions are super simplify if you want it to be. You place ocean tile, then your either a) Move/herd or B) Construct an Outpost. Sure there're a few details on moving but we find it easy enough to understand the rules. The only thing I had about this rule is the limitation of moving maximum of 2 Vikings per action whereas I can load 3 Vikings onto the boat in an action. It makes an interesting choice whether I should march to the other settlements on the same Island or load them onto the ship instead tho. Captain add extra bonus for the score but rather set a nice subtle goal to begin the game. It's still majorly up to the tile being drawn at the time though. The scoring criteria feels balance and diverse. Everything I did seems to contribute to the final score. Even the death from the enemy is something I seek for victory points instead of it being a risk/reward situation.The art on the game is as gorgeous as the past if not more. Familiar faces on captain cards reminded us for the past games and provide quite nice continuity. Also having huge art of them on the card felt much more epic than Raider. Every tile feel different than another and the slightly different settlement designs are great touch. Placing two settlements next on the same island doesn't feel repetitive at all. Livestock art and token are nicely distinguishable with exception of cattle artwork which I have to stare because it looks kinda like horse. The color black and brown is enough to tell the different tho. In fact, all tokens are very distinguishable as well. Longship although a plastic but it has almost exactly the same color as the viking token and the stack design fit snuggly which make it even more awesome. Don't forget the beautiful winter token. If made out of steal, it could double as an awesome design bottle opener as well.Playing until tiles are depleted has a nice effect of knowing exactly how many turn do I have left at the end of the game. Which I felt is just a tad bit too short and too spacious for 2 players.That said with same limited number of tiles I feared the game will feel even shorter and more cutthroat with 4 players. That is remained to be seen and I'm eager to bring this for a session with more friends.TL;DR;It's not perfect. Felt a bit light and I like it.\",\n",
       " ' I just received my Kickstarter copy of   on Saturday, August 27, 2016. My wife, Rachael, and I played our first game on Sunday.I was quite excited to open this game up and get it to the table. Shipping was ahead of schedule for this one, as the date listed on Kickstarter was November 2016.BoxThe box was smaller than I was expecting with a very nice linen finish.The insert is a little cheap, thin cardstock, but seems adequate. We\\'ll see how well it holds up over time.Rule BookThe rule book was very concise and clear. This is a simple game, but it was one of the the better written rule books I have read.ComponentsThe components are very nice. All tiles and captain cards are linen finish. The tiles are smaller than Catan tiles and seem to be cut symmetrically, but Rachael said some of them on her side of the table fit a little weird. This may be from the table top having some warping to it.The wooden bits are all very nice. There are different pieces for each of the different livestock. I did notice one of the red meeples had a void/crack in it. I don\\'t think this will be an issue. And honestly, with as many games as I have played with wooden components, this is not that uncommon.GameplayExplorers of the North Sea is a nice light or light/medium weight game. Both of us compared it to Carcassonne, but slightly advanced. Each player has a hand of three tiles. Each turn starts with placing a tile. After that you have four actions you may perform and then you draw a tile to complete your turn. The game ends when the first player has no tiles left to place.Actions include:Load LongshipUnload LongshipMove LongshipMove VikingsTransport LivestockConstruct an OutpostAll the actions were intuitive enough, having played a variety of euro games. Loading the Longships was the only area we had any confusion. We weren\\'t sure if we needed one viking in the ship and on land or just one viking on the land or just one viking on the Longship to be able to load Livestock. We played as needing one Viking on land to load the Livestock into the ship.Unloading was simple. The rules were very clear that any number of Vikings/Livestock could be unloaded.The Move Longship action is simple and defeating an enemy ship is incorporated with moving into that tile. Moving Vikings was another straightforward action. Raiding Settlements is also incorporated into moving, provided you have enough Vikings on the tile to meet or beat the number located on the settlement token.Transporting Livestock was also a very simple action; one Viking can move one Livestock one tile.Constructing an Outpost takes two of your four actions to complete and placement is similar to building a settlement/city in Catan. An outpost is placed at the intersection of three tiles and then prevents anyone else, including yourself, from building on any space on those tiles. This is a little farther reaching than in Catan, but was easy enough to grasp.Actions can be taken in any order and any number of times, up to four.The placing of tiles was very similar to Carcassonne, but simpler as there is only land and water on each tile. This still lead to some tough decisions on placement though. End of game scoring includes points for the size of islands you control. After the middle of the game, it almost becomes a push your luck type situation with regards to completing islands. Do you keep pushing out the borders and make a larger island or just place a tile that will finish it off?There is definitely some luck involved as to what tile you draw but I am absolutely fine with that. It is Explorers of the North Sea after all.End game scoring is simple, especially with the included score pad. All pages are double sided, which is nice. Just about everything you do scores you points. You are rewarded for building Outposts, collecting Livestock, destroying Enemy Ships, Vikings being killed, Raiding Settlements and controlling islands.It all seemed very thematic, without being overly adult or gratuitously violent. You could definitely play the game with children. In fact, Rachael said the Livestock meeples were \"very cute\".ComplaintsI do think the scoring for the Captains is a little underwhelming. My captain got bonus points equal to the number of tiles away from the Mainland my farthest outpost was. This scored me 7 points. Rachael got an extra point for every pair of livestock she collected, only netting her one extra point.I wish they had a little more impact in final scoring. 7 extra points for my Captain was nice but didn\\'t impact much. 1 extra point for Rachael, to me, seems completely useless. Even the examples in the rulebook don\\'t show many points. I suppose with a group of experienced players, just a few points could mean a win or a loss, but they just seemed lackluster.OverallWe really liked the game. As I said before, it all seemed very thematic. The more vikings that die from attacking enemy ships, the more points they are worth. Death in battle is glorious indeed!My complaint on the Captains is minor. I like that they are a part of the game. They give you a direction to head in from the start, however small that direction may be. Comparing the tiles in your hand to the current board gives some interesting options to mull over while you wait for your turn. Downtime, at least with two players, seems minimal.There doesn\\'t seem to be much interaction in the game other than taking some Livestock off an island or Raiding a Settlement before your opponent can reach it, but that does not detract from our enjoyment.I have only played a two player game, but I imagine the three and four player game would last about the same amount of time as the number of tiles in the game determines how many turns there are. Our first game clocked in at 55 minutes compared to the 45 minutes listed on the box. Now that we are familiar with the rules I expect future plays to come in at 45 minutes or less.If you like  Carcassonne , I think you would like  Explorers of the North Sea . Its a quick, light, enjoyable little game that definitely has a place in my collection.',\n",
       " ' There doesn’t seem to be much written about comparing ENS with Akrotiri. At first glance they seem very similar. They both feature a boat which picks up and delivers goods. Akrotiri Akrotiri is a two player game. If you have two sets you can play it multiplayer but it can cause players to suffer from AP. It has an interesting market mechanism. As player get to chose the second block they place on an Island you can manipulate the market to to increase the cost of resources you are picking up. Players need to be very careful placing tiles to ensure they can complete their map cards. No only do the colours need to be in the right place but you need to ensure there is a jetty so you can claim the Island. There is no direct player interaction although your opponent may claim the island you have your eye on because it meets his objective. You can make it difficult for your opponent to get money by placing goods on islands without jetties. Portage over islands adds another dimension. I really like the Oracle function which allows you to collect the coloured tile you require. There is a nice sense of escalation as you unlock more actions on you turn as the game progresses. Explorers of the North Sea ENS features a similar pick up and deliver mechanism but you always have to have at least on Viking in you boat. It also has set collection element. There is much more player interaction as you can steal animals from under the nose of your opponent. There is a variable set up with ENS. There is also a push you luck element as if you raid an enemy ship you can lose a Viking. You have to plan for the end game to ensure you have a majority on the biggest islands. I like the fact you can choose your end game objectives from a choice of two cards. ENS is much more thematic than Akrotiri. In ENS as the game closes it gets more difficult to get to islands as they get further away. In summary I think the two games have a very different feel. Is there room in your collection for both? I think it depends on how big your collection is. Akrotiri is a great two player game which takes up very little shelf space. I don’t actually like pick up and deliver mechanics much but in Akrotiri it feels less onerous than in ENS due to being able to move as many tiles as you like in each turn. Having said that I really like ENS as well as will probably keep both as I don’t have many games that have direct player interaction and I like playing it solo.']"
