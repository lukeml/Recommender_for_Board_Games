# Recommender_for_Board_Games
I'm a big fan of modern board games, and one of the best resources for board games today is the website, boardgamegeek.com. Until recently, there was no recommender for board games on the site. However, now when you look up a specific game, on the game's page there will be a half dozen games that are recommended. However, the reasons for the recommendations are opaque as there is no explanation given.

In this project, I attempted to build a recommender based on both features of the game scraped from the boardgamegeek database such as game length, complexity, and genre. I also tried to incorporate NLP methods using written reviews on boardgamegeek.
